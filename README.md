# Alist

üóÇÔ∏èA file list program that supports multiple storages, powered by Gin and Solidjs.

This is a fork of https://github.com/AlistGo/alist. And the original project is suspected to have been sold since 2025.

## Document

Been Hacked. **Don't trust any command or link in `alistgo.com` and `alist666` without auditing.**

## Usage

This fork is for development and PR, and only provides the CI version of docker images on `ghcr.io`. There is no image on Docker Hub. And you should not use this if you don't trust me.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/xrgzs/alist:main
```

If you need to run it on other platforms, please compile it yourself.

## Compile

1. Install `git`, `go`. And configure GCC following [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

2. Clone `alist` back-end source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xrgzs/alist --depth=1
   ```

3. Build `alist-web` front-end. You can use the pre-builded dist and extract it to `public/dist`:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://codeload.github.com/xrgzs/alist-web/tar.gz/refs/heads/web-dist -o alist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   tar -zxvf alist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   rm -rf public/dist
   mv -f alist-web-web-dist/dist public
   rm -rf alist-web-web-dist alist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   ```

   Or build it yourself. You should install `nodejs` and `pnpm`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xrgzs/alist-web --depth=1
   cd alist-web
   pnpm install
   pnpm i18n:build
   pnpm build
   cd ..
   rm -rf public/dist
   cp -r alist-web/dist public/dist
   ```

4. Build binary. Do not use build.sh.

   ```bash
   go build main.go
   ```

## Demo

None.

## Discussion
