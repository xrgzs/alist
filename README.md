# DogList

üóÇÔ∏èA file list program that supports multiple storages, powered by Gin and Solidjs.

This is a fork of https://github.com/AlistGo/alist by MadDogOwner. And the original project is suspected to have been sold since 2025.

## Document

Been Hacked. **Don't trust any command or link in `alistgo.com` and `alist666` without auditing.**

## Usage

This fork is for development and PR, and only provides the CI version of docker images on `ghcr.io`. There is no image on Docker Hub. And you should not use this if you don't trust me.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/xrgzs/alist:main
```

If you need to run it on other platforms, please build it yourself.

You can easily build and run by Docker Compose:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/xrgzs/dlist
cd dlist
docker compose up -d
```

## Build

1. Install `git`, `go`. And configure GCC following [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

2. Clone `dlist` back-end source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xrgzs/dlist --depth=1
   ```

3. Build `dlist-web` front-end. You can use the pre-builded dist and extract it to `public/dist`:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://codeload.github.com/xrgzs/dlist-web/tar.gz/refs/heads/web-dist -o dlist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   tar -zxvf dlist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   rm -rf public/dist
   mv -f dlist-web-web-dist/dist public
   rm -rf dlist-web-web-dist dlist-web-web-dist.tar.gz
   ```

   Or build it yourself. You should install `nodejs` and `pnpm`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xrgzs/dlist-web --depth=1
   cd dlist-web
   pnpm install
   pnpm i18n:build
   pnpm build
   cd ..
   rm -rf public/dist
   cp -r dlist-web/dist public/dist
   ```

4. Build binary. Do not use build.sh.

   ```bash
   go build main.go
   ```

## Demo

None.

## Discussion
